This repository contains the code and pdf reference for the "Numerical Solution to the Optimal Portfolio Selection Problem for Power Utility Function."

An investor is interested in maximizing her terminal wealth subject to utility constraints. The algorithm used employs [maximal use of central differences](https://www.jstor.org/stable/40233269), meaning that the algorithm will choose central differencing as long as its use does not violate the positive coefficient criteria. Otherwise, it would choose between forward or backward differencing, depending on whichever satisfy the positive coefficient criteria.
